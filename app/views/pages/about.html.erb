<h2>About</h2>
<h4>The why</h4>
<p>My name is Katherine Abu Hadal and I created I AM MIXED with the goal of creating an online community so people of different ethnic backgrounds could have a space to talk about issues relevant to them.</p>

<p>If you have feedback on the website or otherwise want to get in touch, feel free to contact me.</p>

<h4>The how</h4>
<p>This site was written in Ruby on Rails and JQuery and styled in SCSS with Bourbon, Bitters, Neat, and Refills. The code for this project is available <a href= "https://github.com/katherineabuhadal/i_am_mixed">here</a>.</p>
